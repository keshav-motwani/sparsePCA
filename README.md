# sparsePCA
## A tutorial on sparse principal components analysis

This project was done as a final project for STA4241 Statistical Learning taught by Professor Joseph Antonelli.

In this project, we present the methods of sparse PCA from [Zou et al. 2006](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/spc_jcgs.pdf) and [Witten et al. 2009](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/Correlate/pmd.pdf).

We walk through the derivations for the results presented in these papers in a detailed manner and also walk through how to implement them in R.

Please take a look at the paper and slides in this repository.
